The main purpose of this program is to control NAD amplifiers. It is
not yet ready for general use, but has most of the core functionality
in place. It can not connect to the amplifier directly, but it will
comunicate with a daemon, which in turn can control the amplifier via
RS232. The daemon address is hard coded for now. Expect a less idiotic
way of setting the address soon. Also, be careful if you are testing.
Bugs could lead to damage to speakers and bleeding from ears.
